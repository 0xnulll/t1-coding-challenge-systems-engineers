# Terra One Coding Challenge for System Engineers

## Goal

This challenge is designed to test your ability to handle real-time data processing, implement scalable architectures, and effectively manage distributed microservices.

## Challenge

You can find the challenge [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fhYF3M1IKbiDjCEj_C0Lnv_SIkPPphhG9sWserl_DtI/)

## Setup

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the forked repository
3. Run `npm start` to start all necessary services
4. Run `npm kafka:setup` to create the necessary Kafka topics
5. Implement the challenge. We marked all relevant places with `// YOUR CODE HERE` comments
   - The frontend service is reachable via `http://localhost:3000`. You can use the provided frontend to test your implementation
6. Push your code to your forked repository
7. Submit the link to your forked repository

Happy Coding ðŸš€
